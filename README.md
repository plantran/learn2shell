# Learn2shell

## **Project**

This project was born in 2015 for the event “StartUp for Kids” which took place in the 42 school.  
They asked for some students to create games in order to teach children how to code.

## **Minigame goal**

The user plays a student who hacks the IT system of their school.  
Using only Shell to navigate between the different folders, the student will have to learn how to use the basics shell commands in order to play the game.

## **Prerequisites**
* `ruby-3.1.2`

Configure the following env variable in `.env`:
```
EDITOR_PATH= # Your favourite code editor path
```

## **Usage**

```
bundle install
ruby launch.rb
```

⚠️ CTRL+C will stop the script!

## **Notes**

Keep in mind that this game was created knowing that a student of 42 would help the child during the progress. Some things may not be easy to understand at first, but with some time, everything is doable!
